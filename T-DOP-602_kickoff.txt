Kick-off

Your daily routine
• Coding (sometimes devastately bad ☺ )
• [Compiling your code]

• Checking your code, your logic
• Debugging your code
• Fixing and adjusting your code
• Deploying a new version of your code
• [Breaking something]
• Doing all this again, and again, and again...

What if you ...

• push a non-compiling program at the last minute?

• push a breaking change that has not been tested?
• push a code not respecting the coding style?
• make a typo somewhere in your code?
• forgot a step during the deployment process?
